# Internship-Project
The Cricket Match Scheduling System is a Python project developed as part of an Internship Task. It generates complete cricket tournament fixtures by taking teams, venues, and a start date as input. The system automatically creates round-robin league matches, assigns dates and venues, and organizes Semi-Finals and a Final with winner placeholders.
